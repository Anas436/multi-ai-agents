# multi-ai-agents

In this end-to-end project, I developed a multi-AI agent with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Langraph and AstraDB. This system integrates with the Llama 3.1 open-source model through the Groq API.

AstraDB is a vector database that provides optimized storage and access for vector embeddings and mathematical data representations. It is built on Apache Cassandra, an open-source NoSQL database that powers some of the worldâ€™s largest applications, including Instagram and Netflix.
